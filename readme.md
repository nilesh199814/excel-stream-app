# 📊 Excel Stream API

An Express.js-based API that allows **reading** and **writing** large Excel files using **streaming** techniques for performance and memory efficiency. Suitable for handling large datasets without blocking the event loop.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Upload and stream-read `.xlsx` Excel files
- ✅ Dynamically generate large Excel files with user-defined row counts
- ✅ Efficient memory usage using `exceljs` streaming APIs
- ✅ Clean, modular code structure (Controller, Service, Routes)
- ✅ File cleanup after upload

## 📡 API Endpoints

### 🔼 1. Upload & Read Excel File

**URL**: `/api/excel/upload`
**Method**: `POST`
**Content-Type**: `multipart/form-data`
**Form Field**: `file`

#### ✅ Description:

Uploads an Excel file and returns the parsed rows in JSON format.

#### 🧪 Sample cURL:

```bash
curl -X POST -F "file=@./sample.xlsx" http://localhost:3000/api/excel/upload
```

#### 📥 Sample Response:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "rows": [
    ["Name", "Age"],
    ["Alice", 28],
    ["Bob", 35]
  ]
}
```

---

### 🔽 2. Generate & Download Excel File

**URL**: `/api/excel/download`
**Method**: `POST`
**Content-Type**: `application/json`

#### ✅ Description:

Creates and downloads a large Excel file with the number of rows specified in the request body.

#### 🧾 Request Payload:

```json
{
  "rowCount": 10000
}
```

#### 🧪 Sample cURL:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/excel/download \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"rowCount": 10000}' \
  --output downloaded.xlsx
```

#### 📥 Output:

* The downloaded Excel file will contain 10,000 rows with the following format:

| Column A | Column B         |
| -------- | ---------------- |
| Row 1    | 0.59212748192314 |
| Row 2    | 0.10519028127411 |
| ...      | ...              |

---

## ⚠️ Validations & Errors

* If `rowCount` is missing or invalid in `/download`, you'll get:

```json
{
  "error": "Invalid or missing \"rowCount\" in request body."
}
```

* If no file is sent to `/upload`, Multer will return a `400` error.

---

## 🧼 Cleanup

Uploaded files are stored in the `/uploads` folder temporarily and automatically deleted after processing.

---

## 📈 Performance Tips

* You can test scalability by increasing `rowCount` to 50,000+ in the `/download` endpoint.
* Use streaming read/write to avoid memory overload for massive Excel files.

---

## 📌 To-Do (Optional Enhancements)

* ⏳ Stream response as a file download without full buffering
* 🧪 Add unit tests using Jest or Mocha
* 📄 Validate Excel schema and data before parsing
* 🧰 Add DB support to persist Excel data
* 📊 Add a frontend UI using React or Vue for easier file interaction
* 🔐 Add authentication middleware for protected APIs
